## Quick start

Make sure you have a recent version of Node and `npm` installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Install Node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run a `vite` server with `npx`:

```bash
npx vite
```

The website "Tic Tac Toe" should then be available at `http://localhost:3000/`,
hosted by the `vite` server.

## How to play

You can use your mouse or number pad to pick squares on the tic-tac-toe board.
You can also use the list of steps on the right to jump to any step played.

AI is on by default;
you can toggle it with the button in the top right corner,
and the board will be cleared.

## Credits

Some files, such as `vite.config.js`,
come from a template by Vue's `create` function.
Credits of these files goes to the Vue and `vite` developers.
